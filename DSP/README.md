### corrtest.py
just a simple test of crosscorrelation
#crosscorrtest.py
Another test of crosscorrelation and filtering out signals. 
64000 samples and 100kHz sampling frequency. 

### threesignals.py
Testing the method with three signals with multiple frequency and added noise. The code filters out every signal which is not 40kHz, and crosscorrelates the signal to find the difference. 

### timediff.py
another cross-corr test

### TestDATAFFT.ods
Test data from one hydrophone. The scrips filters out the non-wanted frequencies with FFT
